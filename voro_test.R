# Voronoi Langton tilling.
# Current: 2016/11/23
# Notes: Schl√§fli, Voronoi, tillings
#
# Main remarks for evolution with periodic Voronoi:
# N=1: always classic ant
#
# N=2: 'always' go up-left with RL rules and down_to_up initialization 
#
# N=3: 'always' unbounded, with a straight or snake evolution
# Can go to the left (seed 1, 27), up-left (205), up (3, 25, 110),
#   a-little-left-down (59), right (9), but no other direction.
#
# N=4: as 3, but also includes some bounded evolution with seed
#   seeds 47, 60, 80, 94, 126, 229, 234, 236
#
# N=5: snake loops, which may include a non-connected path
#
# N=6: non-connected bounded path for seed 9; go up-right with seed 87
#
# N=7: bounded with 81, some beautiful snakes.
#
# N=8,9,10: no more behavior observed.

# Initialization of the ant #
#############################
##
# The initial cell of the ant
##
# Method 1:
# We can select the cell where its center is the closest to (0,0)
#
#closest = TRUE
#n = NULL

# Method 2:
# We can find the cells with center in [-0.5,0.5]^2. By definition,
#  if we selected periodic Voronoi there is N cells like this.
# So we can select one of those N cells (indexed with n)
#
closest = FALSE
n = 1 # from 1 to N

##
# The cell from which cell we initially came
## 
# Method 1:
# We can select from the mean value of edges of the cell index_init,
#   take the lowest Im (which should be the "lowest" edge)
#
# from = "bottom_to_up"
# e = NULL

# Method 2:
# We can select all of the E cells around the cell index_init,
#   (indexed with e)
# No error is the e is too large (just skip, no computation)
from = NULL
e = 1 # from 1 to E, E is not known exactly (depend of the tesselation)
